# About

This is the access point part of the rabbits proof of location project. It's
intended to be operated on-site by a trusted party. Tested on a raspberry pi
zero w (not yet, actually) and nothing else. It should *probably* work but I
have make no promises.

# Building

 - Get [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
 - Get [rust-protobuf](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf) (and protobuf)
